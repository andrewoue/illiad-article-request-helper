# ILLiad Article Request Helper

Captures article metadata to auto-fill ILLiad request forms. Supports selectable library profiles. Clipboard copy allows for generic list creation.

---

## Features

- **One-click metadata capture** - click the extension icon on any academic article page to extract citation data including title, author, journal, year, volume, issue, pages, DOI, and ISSN
- **Multi-institution support** - select your library from a dropdown; each institution has its own profile controlling which fields get filled
- **Set as Default** - save your preferred library so it's pre-selected every time
- **Copy to clipboard** - copy clean citation data independently of ILLiad for use in spreadsheets, reference lists, or other workflows

> **Note:** Always review filled fields for accuracy and completeness before submitting your ILLiad request. Metadata quality varies by publisher and some fields may need manual correction or additional information.

## Installation

This extension is not published on the Chrome Web Store. Install it manually as an unpacked extension.

### Download the Files

If you have Git installed, clone this repository to your computer. If not, click the green **Code** button at the top of this page and select **Download ZIP**, then extract the folder contents before proceeding.

### Where to Save the Files

Save the extension folder somewhere stable on your computer. Avoid saving it in Downloads or a cloud-synced folder (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) - if the files are moved or deleted Chrome will lose track of the extension.

**Windows:**
```
C:\Users\[username]\Documents\ChromeExtensions\illiad-article-request-helper\
```
**Mac / Linux:**
```
~/Documents/ChromeExtensions/illiad-article-request-helper/
```

### Install Steps

This extension works on any operating system that supports Google Chrome (Windows, Mac, Linux).

1. Download or clone this repository and save it to the location above
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the folder containing the extension files

The extension icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar.

> **Note:** Do not move or delete the extension folder after installing. Chrome loads the files directly from that location every time. If you need to move it, remove the extension from `chrome://extensions` first, move the folder, then load it again.

## Usage

1. Navigate to an academic article page (e.g. a journal article on a publisher's website)
2. Click the extension icon in the toolbar
3. A new tab opens showing the captured citation data
4. Select your library from the **Library** dropdown (click **Set as Default** to remember it)
5. Open your ILLiad account in another tab and navigate to **New Request - Article**
6. Click **Copy to Open ILLiad Tab** - the extension will fill the form fields automatically
7. **Review all filled fields for accuracy and any fields that may need additional information**
8. Submit your request

To copy citation data to your clipboard without filling an ILLiad form, click **Copy to clipboard**.

## Troubleshooting

**"Fields filled!" message appears in ILLiad Request tab with no auto-switching to ILLiad New Request tab and nothing was filled**
Chrome sometimes keeps recently closed tabs cached in memory. If you closed your ILLiad New Request tab and reopened it, Chrome may still be detecting the old session. Fully close and restart Chrome, then log back into ILLiad and try again.

**"No ILLiad tab found" error**
Make sure you are logged into your institution's ILLiad and have navigated to New Request - Article before clicking "Copy to Open ILLiad Tab".

**Fields are filled but contain incorrect or incomplete data**
Metadata quality varies by publisher. Always review all filled fields before submitting your request and correct anything that looks wrong manually in your ILLiad New Request tab.

**Extension icon does nothing when clicked**
Make sure you are on an http or https page. The extension cannot run on Chrome's internal pages such as chrome://extensions or a new tab page.
